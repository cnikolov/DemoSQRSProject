# DemoSQRSProject
Often SQRS, is not appreciated, anyway what problem does it solve? Using MediatR nuget package. you ar implementing the SQRS pattern along with chain of responsability.
These architectural designs allow you to separate the read/write logic (ideal for fast changing products) or many developers on same product.

The chain of responsability allows us to use Behaviours that we only write ones and they are attached to all our processes in the application, this is optional as shown on the caching.
